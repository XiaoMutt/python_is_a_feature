# Introduction

Python is a great general purpose dynamic scripting language.  
Python features "coding like writing English", "easy to learn" and "fast development".
However, you may step into traps if not careful or unaware of the underlying mechanism.
**python_is_a_feature** summarizes the traps you may encounter for you.

Python is evolving. *python_is_a_feature* uses python3.8. Some "features" may disappear in later version of python,
but new "features" may lead to new "traps". Stay tuned!

# Slogan of this Project

USING PYTHON, "FEATURE" EVERYWHERE
