# Introduction
Python is a great general purpose dynamic scripting language with English-like and literal expressions.  
These features make programming fast. However, also due to these features, you may step into traps if you are not 
careful. *python_is_a_feature* summarizes the traps you may encounter.

Python is evolving. *python_is_a_feature* uses python3.8. Some "features" may disappear in later version of python, 
but new exiting "features" may lead to new "traps". Stay tuned!
